# Completed Labs for EE120: Signals and Systems Fall 2019
This repository contains completed experiments from the "Signals and Systems" course offered by the University of California, Berkeley, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences in the Fall of 2019.

All course materials can be found [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee120/fa19/).

Please note that [this repo](https://github.com/nizne9/EE120-19fa) exclusively contains my self-learning materials and is not officially affiliated with the course.

All code has been formatted using `black`.

## lab1
Introduction to Python for Signals and Systems.

## lab2
Applications of LTI Filtering.

## lab3
The Fast Fourier Transform.

## lab4
Non-Contact Heart Rate Monitoring.

**Note:** The 4 required `.npy` files for `lab4` are stored on [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1a7YFCWma3-B8_fqoM4vijQ). Due to their large size and the fact that nizne9 is too financially constrained to afford `git lfs`, they are hosted there.
